### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Docker with BuildKit support
- Docker Buildx
- Make (optional, for convenience)
- Deno (for local testing)

#### Environment Variables

This project requires authentication to download dependencies and compile the
binary from the Spry repository. You must set the following environment
variables:

```bash
# GitHub Personal Access Token (Classic or Fine-grained)
export GH_TOKEN="your_github_token"

# Auth token for Deno to fetch private raw modules
export DENO_AUTH_TOKENS="${GH_TOKEN}@raw.githubusercontent.com"
```

The tokens are required by `make test`, `make build-all`, and
`make download-deps`.

#### Building Locally

```bash
# Build all packages
make build-all

# Build specific platform
make build-jammy
make build-bookworm
make build-windows

# Compile locally with Deno
make compile-local
```

#### Testing

```bash
# Test the compiled binaries
make test

# Install locally for testing
make install

# Uninstall
make uninstall
```

### Code Style

- Follow YAML best practices in DALEC specs
- Keep the README.md up to date
- Document any new features or changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update documentation as needed
